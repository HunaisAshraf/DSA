<h1>Queue</h1>
    The queue is a sequential collection of elements that follows the First In First Out(FIFO) principle.
    The first element inserted into the queue is the first element to be removed.
    The queue supports two main operations:
    <ul>
        <li>Enqueue - adds an element to the queue</li>
        <li>Dequeue - removes an oldest element from the queue</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Printers</li>
        <li>Callback queue in javascript runtime</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Circular Queue</h1>
    The size of the queue is fixed and a single block of memory is used as if the first element is connected to the last element.
    Also referred to as circular buffer or ring buffer and follows the FIFO priciple.
    A circular queue will reuse the empty block created during deque operation.
    The circular queue supports two main operations.
    <ul>
        <li>Enqueue - add elements to the end</li>
        <li>Dequeue - remove elements from the start</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Application of circular queue</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>clock</li>
        <li>Streaming data</li>
        <li>Traffic lights</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Double-ended queue</h1>
    In a double-ended queue the insertion and deletion operations, both can be performed from both ends. 

<h1>Priority Queue</h1>
    A priority queue is a special queue where the elements are accessed based on the priority assigned to them.
