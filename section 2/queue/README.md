<h1>Queue</h1>
    The queue is a sequential collection of elements that follows the First In First Out(FIFO) principle.
    The first element inserted into the queue is the first element to be removed.
    The queue supports two main operations:
    <ul>
        <li>Enqueue - adds an element to the queue</li>
        <li>Dequeue - removes an oldest element from the queue</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Applications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Printers</li>
        <li>Callback queue in javascript runtime</li>
    </ul>
