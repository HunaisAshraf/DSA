<h1>Hash Table</h1>
    Also known as Hash Map, is a data structure that is used to store key-value pairs. Given a key, you can associate a value with that key for very fast lookup. A Hash table is defined as a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly. It operates on the hashing concept, where each key is translated by a hash function into a distinct index in an array. The index functions as a storage location for the matching value. In simple words, it maps the keys with the value.
