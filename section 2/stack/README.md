<h1>Stack</h1>
    A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed.
    That last element inserted will be the first to remove from the stack.
    The stack data structure supports two main operations.
    <ul>
        <li>Push - adds an element to the collection</li>
        <li>Pop - removes the most recently added elements</li>
    </ul>
