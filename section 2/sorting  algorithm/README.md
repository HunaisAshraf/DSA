<h1>Sorting Algorithm</h1>
    A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.
    <h3>Different Sorting Algorithm</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bubble sort</li>
        <li>Selection sort</li>
        <li>Insertion sort</li>
        <li>Quick sort</li>
        <li>Merge sort</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Bubble sort</h3>
    Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
    <h5>Time complecity - O(n^2)</h5>

<h3>Selection sort</h3>
    Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 
    <h5>Time complecity - O(n^2)</h5>

<h3>Insertion sort</h3>
    Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
    <h5>Time complecity - O(n^2)</h5>

<h3>Merge sort</h3>
    Merge sort is defined as a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.
    <h5>Time complecity - O(n log n)</h5>

<h3>Quick sort</h3>
    QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
    <h5>Time complexity</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Worst case - O(n^2)</li>
        <li>Best case - O(n log n)</li>
    </ul>
