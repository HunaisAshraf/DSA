<h3>Linear Search</h3>
    A linear search is a simple search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the entire list has been searched. The time complexity of a linear search is O(n), where "n" is the number of elements in the list.
    <h5>Big O - O(n)</h5>

<h3>Binary Search</h3>
    Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, then the search continues in the lower half of the interval. If the value of the search key is greater, then the search continues in the upper half. This process continues until the target value is found or the interval is empty.
    <h5>Big O - O(log n)</h5>
