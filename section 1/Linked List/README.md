<h1>Linked List</h1>
    Linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node.
    The elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation  or reorganisation  of the entire structure.
    Random access of elements has linear time complexity.
    There are two type of linked list:
    <ul>
        <li>Singly Linked List</li>
        <li>Doubly Linked List</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Big O of Linked List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Traversal - O(n)</li>
        <li>Access and search - O(n)</li>
        <li>insert/delete at beginning or end - O(1)</li>
        <li>insert/delete in middle - O(n)</li>
    </ul>
