<h1>Recursion</h1>
    Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursive solutions are often elegant and can be used  to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. 
    Recursion works by invoking the same function with different input until you reach the base case. The base case is when the recursion ends.
