<h1>Trees</h1>
    A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 
    The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.

<h1>Binary Tree</h1>
    A binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.


<h1>Breadth-First Search</h1>
    Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a traversal or search algorithm that explores a tree or graph level by level. In the context of trees, BFS starts at the root and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It visits all the nodes at the current depth level before moving on to nodes at the next level.
